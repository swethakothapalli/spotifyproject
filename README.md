Project Title: Music Tracks Data Analysis and Visualization
Description:
This project involves the comprehensive analysis of a large dataset of music tracks using Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries. The key objectives were to explore and understand the patterns and relationships between various attributes of the tracks, such as popularity, duration, danceability, energy, loudness, and more.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Loaded a CSV file containing music track data using Pandas.
Handled missing values and converted relevant data types for analysis.
Set the release date as the index and converted it to a datetime format for time-based analysis.
Transformed duration from milliseconds to seconds for better interpretability.
Descriptive Statistics and Sorting:

Generated summary statistics for numerical columns to understand data distribution.
Sorted tracks based on popularity to identify the least popular tracks.
Filtering and Querying:

Filtered tracks with popularity greater than 90 to identify highly popular tracks.
Queried the dataset to retrieve specific artist information and track details.
Correlation Analysis:

Computed the correlation matrix to examine relationships between variables.
Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap with Seaborn to highlight significant correlations.
Regression Plots:

Created regression plots to visualize the relationship between:
Loudness and energy
Popularity and acousticness
Sampling:

Generated a random sample of 0.4% of the dataset for efficient plotting and analysis.
Technologies Used:

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
Visualizations:

Correlation Heatmap: Showcasing the correlation between various track attributes.
Regression Plots: Highlighting relationships such as loudness vs. energy and popularity vs. acousticness.
This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, showcasing the ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
